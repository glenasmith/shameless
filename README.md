# Grails Hacker Triage Sample

This repo is going to host a sample app with a series of shameless Grails hacks that Glen has been [blogging about](http://blogs.bytecode.com.au/glen/2011/09/16/grails-hacker-triage-when-bad-code-happens-to-good-developers.html). This is getting put together for a talk at [SpringOne2GX](http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/chicago/2011/10/home). 

More info here as things get underway.
